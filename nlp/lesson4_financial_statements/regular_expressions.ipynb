    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following lessons we will learn how to create basic **Regular Expressions** in Python. Regular Expressions, also known as Regexes, are used to find different patterns of text. In general, regexes work by first specifying the rules for the set of possible patterns that you want to find and then making queries such as \"Is this pattern found at the beginning of this string?\" or “Is there a match for this pattern anywhere in this string?”. We will learn for example, how to write regular expressions to find phone numbers, names, and email addresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end this lesson you should be able to read and write basic regular expressions in Python and know how to apply them to get useful financial information from 10-Ks."

    "\n",
    "In Python string literals are specified using either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`); and the backslash (`\\`) character is used to escape characters that have a special meaning, such as a newline (`\\n`) or tab (`\\t`). Let's see a simple example:"

This means that you don’t want characters preceded by a backslash (`\\`) to be interpreted as special characters. In these cases, you can prefix the string literal with the letter `r`. Such strings are known as **Raw Strings** and treat backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters. To see how this works, let's print the same string literal we had before but now as a raw string:"

    "We can clearly see that by adding an `r` before the first quote of the string literal, both `\\n` and `\\t`, are no longer treated as special characters. It is important to note, that the `r` doesn't change the type of the string literal, but rather, it just changes how the string literal is interpreted. So, without the `r`, backslashes are used to escape characters and with the `r`, backslashes are treated as literal characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using raw strings to create our regular expressions, because regular expressions themselves, also use the backslash character (`\\`) to indicate their own special characters. Therefore, by using raw strings, we avoid the problem of Python interpreting the special characters in regexes in the wrong way."

    "# 2. Finding Words Using Regexes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will learn how to find letters and words in a string using regular expressions. Throughout these lessons, we will use the `re` module from Python's standard library to work with regular expressions. The `re` module not only contains functions that allow us to check if a given regular expression matches a particular string, but also contains functions that allow us to modify strings in various ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by using a regular expression to find all the locations of a single letter in a given string. To do this, we will use the `re.compile()` function from the `re` module. The `re.compile(pattern)` function converts a regular expression `pattern` into a regular expression object. This allows us to save our regular expressions into objects that can be used later to perform pattern matching using various methods, such as `.match()`, `.search()`, `.findall()`, and `.finditer()`. Let’s see how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we will find all the locations of the letter `a` in a string named `sample_text`. In this case, our regular expression pattern will just be `'a'` and we will pass it to the `re.compile()` function as a raw string. We will save the regular expression object returned by the `re.compile()` function in a variable called `regex`. We will then use the `.finditer()` method to search our `sample_text` for the given regular expression contained in the `regex` object. The `.finditer()` method returns an iterator with all the non-overlapping matches of our regular expression pattern in the string. We should also mention that the `.finditer()` method scans the strings from left-to-right, and returns the matches in the order found. Since the `.finditer()` method returns an iterator, we can loop through it to print all the matches, as shown below:"

    "Being able to match letters and metacharacters is the simplest task that regular expressions can do. In this section we will see how we can use regular expressions to perform more complex pattern matching. We can form any pattern we want by using the metacharacters mentioned in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first metacharacter we are going to look at is the backslash (`\\`). We already saw that the backslash can be used to escape all the metacharacters, so that you can search for them directly. However, the backslash can also be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. Here is a list of the special sequences we are going to look at in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\d` - Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the set [0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\D` - Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the set [^0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\s` - Matches any whitespace character, this is equivalent to the set [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\S` - Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the set [^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\w` - Matches any alphanumeric character and the underscore; this is equivalent to the set [a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\W` - Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the set [^a-zA-Z0-9_]\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that there is a difference between lowercase and uppercase sequences. For example, while `\\d` matches any digit, `\\D` matches everything that is **not** a digit. Similarly, while `\\s` matches any whitespace character, `\\S` matches everything that is **not** a whitespace character; and while `\\w` matches any alphanumeric character, `\\W` matches everything that is **not** an alphanumeric character.\n",
